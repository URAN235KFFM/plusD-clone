# The +D Interface Disk for ZX Spectrum
the schematic and PCB for this interfaz, make in KICAD
Including gerber files to direct order, the PCB is less than 10x10cm so it's very cheap.
Al BOM for order 10 units is also available, some PCB manufacturer allow to order at same time than PCB
Aditionaly ICs and Edge conector is needed.

dificult to found a WD1772, WD1770 can be used as a alternative.
WD1773, probably can be used, JP4 and JP5 must be changed to allow alternative motor control.
