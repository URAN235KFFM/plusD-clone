GALPLUSD_G22V10.pld is the source code for the the kempston interfaz part of this clone.
This also include non functional code to use as motor-on signal in case of use a WD1773.

Kempston.JED is the file you must use to burn on a GAL22V10

GALPLUSD_AFT750V.pld is a alternative source code for the advanced GAL from Atmel/Microchip, useless by now (mainly because there is no afordable burner for this devices).
